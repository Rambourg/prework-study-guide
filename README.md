It could put me in contact with this new techniques and I learned a lot by doing it. -It can show my point of view of basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript for beginners. I leanerd that code is a building block issue where the sky is not the limit. Computer language can be use to do almost everything and create new solutions for people.
